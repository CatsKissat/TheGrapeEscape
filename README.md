# The Grape Escape
A Unity game I originally made at [Ahlman](https://ahlmanedu.fi/koulutushaku/peliohjelmoinnin-linja/) in a week.

I started to update the game after ~2 years for fun.

This repository is just for the to-do list tracking.

You are able to play the game at [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252020/Ahlman_Mansion_2020/) (a part of the Ahlman Mansion) or at [itch.io](https://catskissat.itch.io/the-grape-escape).
