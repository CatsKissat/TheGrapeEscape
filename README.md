# The Grape Escape
The Grape Escape is a 3D platformer where you as a grape have to escape from a house. The name and the idea are loosely based on _The Great Escape_ movie.

A Unity game I made at [Ahlman](https://ahlmanedu.fi/koulutushaku/peliohjelmoinnin-linja/) in a week in 2019.

You are able to play the game at [Steam (v1.0)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252020/Ahlman_Mansion_2020/) (a part of the Ahlman Mansion) or at [itch.io (v1.0)](https://catskissat.itch.io/the-grape-escape).
